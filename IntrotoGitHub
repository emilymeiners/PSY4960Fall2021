Welcome to our GitHub Repository! 
I HOPE THIS IS RIGHT BECAUSE I'M TRYING SO HARD RIGHT NOW
1. I learned some of the terminology, like push and pull and branches
2. I'm very confused on what issues are (obviously lol) and branches, I feel like I'm editing something that I shouldn't be editing (I don't know if that makes sense)
